## Example 1: User-Specific Prediction Explanation

**Query:** "Why is user 102's productivity score 78?"

**Intent:** user_explanation (confidence: 0.95)

**Output:**

## Explanation for user_102

The model predicts a value of **78.5** for user_102, which is 9.5 points below baseline of 88.0. This prediction is based on an analysis of 5 features.

### Top Contributing Factors

The following features had the strongest influence on this prediction:

1. **task_switching** (value: 15)
   - Effect: decreased prediction by 0.310
   - Contribution: 40.0% of total effect

2. **sleep_deficit** (value: 2.5)
   - Effect: decreased prediction by 0.220
   - Contribution: 28.5% of total effect

3. **meeting_hours** (value: 4.2)
   - Effect: decreased prediction by 0.150
   - Contribution: 19.4% of total effect

4. **focus_time** (value: 3.5)
   - Effect: increased prediction by 0.080
   - Contribution: 10.3% of total effect

5. **collaboration_score** (value: 7.8)
   - Effect: increased prediction by 0.050
   - Contribution: 6.5% of total effect


### Historical Context

- **Current value:** 78.5
- **Historical baseline:** 88.0
- **Difference:** -9.5 (-10.8%)
- **Recent average (last_30_days):** 85.2
- **Percentile rank:** 35th percentile

**Confidence Level:** High confidence

**Important Limitations:**
- Explanation is based on correlational patterns, not causal relationships
- SHAP values show feature importance for this specific instance
- Model assumptions may not hold for out-of-distribution data
- Feature interactions beyond pairwise may not be fully captured

## Example 2: Feature Importance

**Query:** "What are the most important features in the model?"

**Intent:** feature_importance (confidence: 0.90)

**Output:**

## Model Feature Importance

The model uses 5 features for predictions. Below are the features ranked by their overall importance across all predictions.

### Top Features by Importance

| Rank | Feature Name | Importance Score | % Contribution |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | task_switching | 0.3100 | 40.0% |
| 2 | sleep_deficit | 0.2200 | 28.5% |
| 3 | meeting_hours | 0.1500 | 19.4% |
| 4 | focus_time | 0.0800 | 10.3% |
| 5 | collaboration_score | 0.0500 | 6.5% |

### Model Performance

- **Model type:** gradient_boosting
- **Primary metric:** r2_score = 0.8470

**Additional metrics:**
- rmse: 6.2300
- mae: 4.8100

- **Evaluated on:** 2500 samples

**Important Limitations:**
- Feature importance calculated using global method
- Global importance may not reflect individual prediction patterns
- Feature interactions and correlations affect interpretation
- Importance scores are relative, not absolute measures

## Example 3: Refusal (Advice Request)

**Query:** "What should I do to improve user 102's score?"

**Intent:** advice_request (confidence: 0.95)

**Is Refusal:** True

**Output:**

I cannot answer this request. This appears to be a request for advice or recommendations. I am designed to explain model outputs, not provide guidance on actions. 

What I can do: Explain what the model predicts and why, but the decision on how to use this information must be yours.

## Example 4: Refusal (Prediction Request)

**Query:** "What will user 102's score be tomorrow?"

**Intent:** prediction_request (confidence: 0.95)

**Is Refusal:** True

**Output:**

I cannot answer this request. This appears to be a request for a prediction or forecast. I can only explain existing model outputs, not generate new predictions. 

What I can do: Explain why a specific prediction was made, or describe which features are most important in the model.
