# Explainable Analytics Copilot (XAC) Requirements
# Python 3.12+ required

# Core dependencies (minimal, all free)
# No paid APIs or cloud services required

# Data processing
numpy>=1.24.0

# For actual ML projects, you would typically have:
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0  # For model training and feature importance
# shap>=0.42.0         # For SHAP value computation
# pandas>=2.0.0        # For data manipulation

# Development and demo
jupyter>=1.0.0        # For demo notebook
notebook>=7.0.0       # Jupyter notebook interface

# Optional: For enhanced demos (not required for core functionality)
matplotlib>=3.7.0     # For visualizations in demo
seaborn>=0.12.0       # For statistical visualizations

# Testing (optional)
# pytest>=7.4.0
# pytest-cov>=4.1.0

# Code quality (optional)
# black>=23.0.0
# flake8>=6.0.0
# mypy>=1.4.0

# Note: This project is designed to work with MINIMAL dependencies
# The core copilot functionality only requires Python standard library
# Additional packages are for demos, testing, and integration with ML systems
